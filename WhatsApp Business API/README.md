# Create With Whatsapp Business API


The WhatsApp Business API. However, it's important to note that the WhatsApp Business API is not publicly available and requires approval from WhatsApp, as well as a business verification process.

Assuming you have access to the WhatsApp Business API, here's an example of how you could build a simple chatbot in Python



In this example, we're using the Chat API service to send and receive messages from WhatsApp. The send_message function sends a message to a specific phone number, and the process_message function processes incoming messages and sends a response. The webhook function is a Flask endpoint that listens for incoming messages from the Chat API service and passes them to the process_message function.

To use this chatbot, you'll need to sign up for the Chat API service and obtain your own API credentials. You'll also need to configure a webhook URL in your Chat API account settings to point to the URL of your Flask app.

Note that while this approach allows you to build a WhatsApp chatbot without using Twilio, it does require you to sign up for a third-party service and may involve additional costs depending on the pricing plan of the service you choose.
