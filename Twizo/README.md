# Create using Twizo


To use Twizo for building a WhatsApp chatbot, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a Twizo account: Go to the Twizo website (https://www.twizo.com/) and sign up for an account. Once you've created an account, you'll need to verify your phone number and email address.

2. Apply for the WhatsApp Business API: Twizo is an official WhatsApp Business Solution Provider, which means they can provide access to the WhatsApp Business API. You'll need to submit an application to Twizo and provide information about your business and the type of chatbot you want to build.

3. Complete the verification process: After your application is approved, Twizo will guide you through the WhatsApp Business verification process. You'll need to provide documents and other information to verify your business and ensure that you comply with WhatsApp's policies.

4. Integrate with Twizo's API: Twizo provides an API for integrating with their WhatsApp Business API solution. You'll need to use their API to send and receive messages on the WhatsApp platform.

5. Build your chatbot: Once you've completed the integration with Twizo's API, you can start building your chatbot. Twizo provides documentation and tools to help you build your chatbot and automate your customer communication.



In this example, the 'send_message()' and 'receive_message()' functions use Twizo's API to send and receive messages, respectively. You'll need to replace 'your_twizo_api_key_here' with your actual Twizo API key.

Keep in mind that you'll also need to modify the code that handles the message processing and logic to work with Twizo's API. This may involve updating the message format and structure, as well as any other functions or libraries that interact with the WhatsApp Business API.
