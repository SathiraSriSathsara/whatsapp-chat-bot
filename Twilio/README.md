# Create with Twilio API


Here, we're using Flask to create a web server that listens for incoming messages from WhatsApp. When a message is received, the bot function is called, which checks the message contents and sends a response using the Twilio API.

To use this chatbot, you'll need to set up a Twilio account and create a WhatsApp Sandbox. Once you have your Twilio credentials, you can run this script and configure your Twilio Sandbox to send incoming messages to the URL of your Flask app.

Note that this is just a simple example and you'll likely want to customize the bot's responses and add more functionality. Also, keep in mind that while Twilio provides a free trial, there may be fees associated with sending messages to and from WhatsApp.



## Installation


1. Create a Twilio account if you don't already have one.

2. In your Twilio console, create a WhatsApp Sandbox. This will give you a WhatsApp number to use for your bot, as well as a URL to which Twilio will send incoming messages.

3. Install Flask and the Twilio Python library. You can use pip to install them:

```bash
 pip install flask twilio

```
4. Copy the example code I provided into a file called "app.py".

5. Replace the placeholder values in the "app.py" file with your own Twilio account SID, auth token, and WhatsApp number.

6. Run the Flask app by running this command in the terminal:

```bash
 python app.py

```
7. In your Twilio console, go to the Sandbox Settings for your WhatsApp Sandbox and set the "When a message comes in" field to "Webhook" and the "Webhook URL" to the URL of your Flask app (e.g., http://localhost:5000/bot if you're running the app locally).

8. Start sending messages to your bot's WhatsApp number and see the responses!


Note that if you want to deploy your chatbot to a production server, you'll need to use a production-grade web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI instead of the built-in Flask development server. You'll also need to configure a domain name and SSL certificate for your app. But for testing purposes, running the app locally is fine.
